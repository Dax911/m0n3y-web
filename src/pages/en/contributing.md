### The Rules

- Be respectful, civil, and open-minded.
- Before opening a new pull request, try searching through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) for known issues or fixes.
- This is a place for collaboration and learning not memes or jokes.
- If you want to make code changes based on your personal opinion(s), make sure you open an issue first describing the changes you want to make, and open a pull request only when your suggestions get approved by maintainers.

### Getting Started

After you have checked to make sure your issue or change is not already being worked on, you should open your own [issue](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/new) describing the problem or feature you want to work on.

To make a contribution, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes. (Always working from the `next` branch)
4. Make your changes and commit them.
5. Push your changes to your forked repository.
6. Create a pull request to the original repository.

Be sure and check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) for feedback on your changes.


## Code Guidelines

While I am not personally a stickler for any particular style guide, it is important to maintain consistency and readability in the codebase. Additionally, this codebase is meant to be a place for new developers to learn and contribute so having a clear and concise guidelines like those they will encounter in a professional setting is good practice.

### Code Style

- Use consistent indentation and spacing.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep code concise and readable.

### How this Repository Is Structured

This website uses [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for its frontend framework and styling respectively. The repository is organized into several directories:

- `src`: Contains the source code for the website.
- `src/pages`: Contains the pages for the website. Which holds the individual `.astro` files and the content markdown for each page.
- `src/components`: Contains reusable components used across the website.
- `src/layouts`: Contains layout components used across the website.
- `src/utils`: Contains utility functions and helpers.
- `src/hooks`: Contains custom hooks for managing state and side effects. (if there are any needed not in the codebase currently)
- `public`: Holds static assets such as images and fonts.
- `dist`: Generated output after building the project.
- `node_modules`: Dependencies installed via npm.

To learn more about the specifics of this framework and styling, refer to the official documentation for [Astro](https://astro.build/docs/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/).
