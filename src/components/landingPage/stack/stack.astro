        <Feature title="Solana" href="https://www.solana.com/">
          <Fragment slot="description">
            Bring blockchain to the people. Solana supports experiences for
            power users, new consumers, and everyone in between. Solana's native
            token, SOL, is used for transaction fees and staking rewards. The
            network is designed to be scalable, secure, and energy-efficient,
            making it an attractive option for developers and businesses looking
            to build decentralized applications (dApps).

            Seamless integration with the Pump.fun contract as the governance
            token, enabling community-driven decision making and true
            decentralization. Stay informed about the latest updates and
            developments on the upcoming DAO governance.

        <Feature title="Zero Knowledge Proofs" href="https://zkp.science/">
          <Fragment slot="description">
            Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are revolutionizing blockchain security
            and privacy. They allow verification of information without
            revealing underlying data, enabling private transactions, scalable
            solutions, and enhanced data protection. ZKPs are crucial for
            developing next-generation decentralized applications (dApps) that
            meet stringent privacy and efficiency requirements.

        <Feature title="Offline-First Architecture" href="#">
          <Fragment slot="description">
            Designed for real-world usability, our system allows offline token
            minting and local transfers via Bluetooth/NFC, with private
            reconciliation through zero-knowledge proofs when back online.

        <Feature title="zkSNARKs" href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/">
          <Fragment slot="description">
            zkSNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of
            Knowledge) are a specific type of zero-knowledge proof used in
            blockchain projects like Zcash. They allow for efficient
            verification of computations without revealing inputs, enhancing
            privacy in transactions and smart contracts while maintaining the
            integrity and transparency of the blockchain.
